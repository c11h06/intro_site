    <h2>Background Info</h2>
    <p>Welcome, stranger! I can't imagine what depraved Internet deep-dive led you here but thanks for checking out the site! You're probably asking yourself:<br><br>
    
    <em>Why does this page even exist?</em><br><br>
    
    Great question! I primarily started it for three reasons:
      <ul class="reasons">
        <li><div>1. To document my journey from scrub to somewhat competent web dev. As I'm sure you can tell, it's still <b>very</b> early days.</div></li>

        <li><div>2. I liked the idea of maintaining a website where I can implement <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> tricks as I learn them. And most importantly,</div></li>

          <li><div>3. I made this because Elie told me to.</div></li>
        </ul>
        Hopefully I continue to learn and grow in the field, and I'm looking forward to regularly updating both the site and anyone interested along the way!</p>
